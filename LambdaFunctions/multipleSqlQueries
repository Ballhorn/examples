The function takes the following inputs
  "conn": Connection string to your database
  "sql": An array of sql query strings you want to run
  
The function uses pg to connect to a postgreSQL instance. It can be used to connect to a Redshift cluster. Pg is included in the zip file.
If you want to connect to an RDS instance or a Redshift cluster in a VPC your function must be in the same VPC, and use same subnets an a security group than your instance.

Function creates a promise from each sql query. The promise runs the query and resolves with query results.
After the promises are resolved the function closes the connection and calls back with the results.
